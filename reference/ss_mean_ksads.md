Internal function for all ksads summary score functions.

## Usage

``` r
ss_mean_ksads(data, name, vars, max_na, exclude, combine)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  tbl. Data frame containing the columns to be summarized.

- name:

  character. Name of the summary score column.

- vars:

  character vector. Names of the columns to be summarized.

- max_na:

  numeric, positive whole number. Number of missing items allowed.
  `NULL` means no limit.

- exclude:

  character vector. Values to be excluded from the summary score
  calculation.

## Details

KSADS summary scores are mostly calculating the means over variables,
but there are two special codes to handle:

- `"888"`: item skipped by branching. When at least one input value is
  observed, any `888` value is converted to "0" prior to averaging.

- `"555"`: module not administered. If any input variable is "555" leave
  the score as `NA`.

- `NA`: missing value. If at least one input value is observed, any `NA`
  values are converted to "0" prior to averaging. If all inputs are
  `NA`, the summary score remains `NA`.
